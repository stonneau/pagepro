<br/><h2>Award: "Digital Technology Grand Prize" for our ANR project Entracte 11/10/2016</h2>
The Entracte project, coordinated between the team Gepetto (LAAS CNRS, Toulouse) and Mimetic (Inria, Rennes) has been awarded today with this distinction. We are really proud of this acknowledgement of a project that we enjoyed achieving, and of the results we obtained. I was strongly
involved in the project, as a PhD student and as a post doc, as one of the three main axes was based on my contributions. Congratulations to Nicolas Mansard and Charles Pontonnier, the main coodinators of the project, as well as to all the project members!

<h2>Workshop on multi-contact planning at IROS: 11/17/2016</h2>
On friday the 14th of october ait IROS, we organize a full-day workshop on thechallenges of multi contact planning and robot control. Various reknowned speakers from all countries, from both robotics andgraphics community will give a speech.

<h1><a href="#">About me</a></h1><br/>
<h2>(Really) short bio</h2>
Steve Tonneau is a post-doctorate in the <a href="http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php/">Gepetto</a> team. He defended his Phd in 2015 after 3 years in the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/mimetic/">INRIA/IRISA Mimetic</a> research team. His research focuses on kinematic motion planning based on the biomechanical analysis of motion invariants. Applications include computer graphics animation as well as robotics.
