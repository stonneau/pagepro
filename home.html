<h2>(Really) short bio</h2>
Steve Tonneau is a post-doctorate in the <a href="http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php/">Gepetto</a> team. He defended his Phd in 2015 after 3 years in the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/mimetic/">INRIA/IRISA Mimetic</a> research team. His research focuses on kinematic motion planning based on the biomechanical analysis of motion invariants. Applications include computer graphics animation as well as robotics.
