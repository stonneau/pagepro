<h2>Conditionally accepted paper: " Zero Step Capturability for Legged Robots in Multi Contact " - 10/09/2017</h2>
Our paper, first authored by my co-worker Andrea Del Prete, was conditionally accepted to transactions on robotics (T-RO).
It is available here <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01574687/document">(link)</a>, and you can find the video here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjVcNeMapN8&feature=youtu.be">(link)</a>.

<h2>"The loco3d project" - 07/26/2017</h2>
For a few months now, our team has been working on a really ambitious project with our humanoid robots.
We aim at developping a complete workflow, that will integrate seemlessly planning, trajectory optimization and control
of the robot in a complex multicontact scenario. Find more about loco3d <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318487540_Multi-contact_Locomotion_of_Legged_Robots_in_Complex_Environments_-_The_Loco3D_project">here</a>.<br/><br/><br/>


<h2>Publication: "A Kinodynamic steering-method for legged multi-contact locomotion" - 07/26/2017</h2>
Our paper, first authored by my PhD student Pierre Fernbach, will be presented at IROS 17. It extends our contact planner to handle truly dynamic situations, where quasi-static motions are not an option.
It is available here <a href="./files/publications/iros17/root.pdf">(link)</a>, and you can find the video here <a href="./files/publications/iros17/kinodynamic_steering_method_for_legged_multicontact_locomotion.mp4">(link)</a>.

<h2>New submission: "An efficient acyclic contact planner for multiped robots" -  01/25/2016</h2>
We resubmitted our paper on multi-contact planning with additional results. Now, all our contact
plans are validated in a physics simulation or on the real robot. If you want to see HRP-2 get our of a car, take a look at the project page:  <a href="./files/publications/isrr15/isrr15.html">(link)</a>.

<h2>Award: "Digital Technology Grand Prize" for our ANR project Entracte 11/10/2016</h2>
The Entracte project, coordinated between the team Gepetto (LAAS CNRS, Toulouse) and Mimetic (Inria, Rennes) has been awarded today with this distinction. We are really proud of this acknowledgement of a project that we enjoyed achieving, and of the results we obtained. I was strongly
involved in the project, as a PhD student and as a post doc, as one of the three main axes was based on my contributions. Congratulations to Nicolas Mansard and Charles Pontonnier, the main coodinators of the project, as well as to all the project members!

<h1><a href="#">About me</a></h1><br/>
<h2>(Really) short bio</h2>
Steve Tonneau is a post-doctorate in the <a href="http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php/">Gepetto</a> team. He defended his Phd in 2015 after 3 years in the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/mimetic/">INRIA/IRISA Mimetic</a> research team. His research focuses on kinematic motion planning based on the biomechanical analysis of motion invariants. Applications include computer graphics animation as well as robotics.
