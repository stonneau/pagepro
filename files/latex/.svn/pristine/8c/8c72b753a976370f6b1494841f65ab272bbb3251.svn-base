I am writing to apply as student volunteer for EuroGraphics 2014.
I am a phd student in computer animation, based at IRISA Rennes, under
the supervision of Julien Pettr\'e and Franck Multon.

For me this would be the occasion to attend one of the most important
event of the year for the computer graphics community. As my phd is coming
to an end, I would like to seize the opportunity to extend my relation
network while I'm looking for a post-doctorate opportunity.

In the last few years I had the chance to
assist in the organization of events such as the 2013 edition of Motion In Games in Rennes.
I held a booth for my former company, MASA Group, at the international EURO SATORY exhibition.
Although my native language is french, I speak english fluently, thanks to the six months I spent in the united states
as a student.

A social person, I think my profile meets your expectations.
I hope that you'll be interested in my formation and my experiences. I thank you for the attention you'll pay to my application.

I look forward to meeting you.
